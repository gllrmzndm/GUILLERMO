Main purpose of this blog post is actually not talking about Fortnite itself, more like an observation about people in general in a given space.

I’m starting with a controversial game called Fortnite, because that’s the “mainstream” video game available at my disposal, that is easier to run on my different hardware. In this case it’s on my Nintendo Switch and non-gaming laptop. (I don’t buy gaming laptops. Simply because I got a Nintendo Switch.)

The reason why I chose Fortnite, because people told me that it was a “bad” game.
Building is considered as a dealbreaker for these people, since a lot of people can build things quickly and get advantage over people that “can’t” do anything. (“Can’t” because you obviously can.) even without building, you can take advantage over people that are building properly but… you need to have a strategy.

Easier opponents… 
This time around, playing with different kinds of people from the Netherlands. The barrier(s) of understanding each other, giving instructions, winning and getting a strategy should be less. But there are other certain factors that I wasn’t aware of. People explained to me that If you’re playing on a Nintendo Switch, you should get easier opponents, because PC gamers, Playstation and Xbox -gamers aren’t in the same space. Also your account level does determine against which players you’re going to battle. My point being is… that people sought a way to get easier opponents in the battle royal. Since I was the player, playing a Nintendo Switch with not many hours and low account level. Most of the time I was given the task to be a part leader. In their eyes, we should get easier opponents.

Easier opponents don't always fix the issue(s), when you want to be more competent at (insert your sports, work, game or whatever in here) playing with these people when losing, was kind of demanding. First of all, most of the time I was playing with adults above and under thirty years old. Most of the time we lost, we weren’t being smart at all.
Playing in squad and each taking another building (I know it’s controversial) is considered stupid from my point. If the building has multiple floors, the best idea is to take another floor, but if that isn’t enough, two people need to get another building. But stay relatively close to each other.

A lot of times people died, because we were too far away from each other. One person dies, three of the squad are being leftover and it’s 4 vs 3 or worse, when there are several squads assembled close to each other.

Another part where we lost the battle is… communicating which person we are shooting, if there’s somebody behind us or when to start building an apartment complex. Either way it was most of the time the other person's fault. Back in the Xbox 360/ Playstation 3 days, 

playing Battlefield Bad Company was more enjoyable for me. Leveraging the ping system and knowing people their main weapons and skills was a good part.
Vocabulary or understanding of each other was bad, there are several shotgun and assault rifles in game and calling them all “AR” or “Shotgun” isn’t going to end well. Especially when we lose due to the part where the opponent is very close and my teammates got shotgunned from close proximity. Not leveraging or understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon is kind of painful.

The people I played with had more than 2000 hours in this particular game and the best people that I had as a team, were the people that could build really well. Only to forget your teammates in the process is again bad. E.g. teammates outside the building (apartment complex) get shot first, due no shielding. Opponents get close and take the loot. Destroys the building in the process and it’s 3 vs 4 or worse.

Every game is walking without thinking, getting mad at each other as adults and not significantly improving each other. Same thing happened at work, “basic mistakes” even “experienced” people. A lot of the blaming is part where people don’t take proven and verified feedback. An example would be a video.
This time around these people still make the same mistakes and the same goes for work.

I have won a lot of games, but I’m not really proud of that (probably another blog post coming up, about this particular thing…) because I’m not satisfied and Fortnite is not really on my list to get really good at and play a lot of it. (It’s a game to socialize with other people.)

Like Mike Wells said from: (http://atlasf1.autosport.com/98/mon/wells.html)

*Just as in warfare, the smaller of two opponents must out-think and out manoeuvre their larger foe if they wish to win, no less survive.*
*Some may resign themselves with boredom towards F1, but a large part of that is because the important action takes place out of sight. ~ Mike Wells*

Same goes for Fornite too, what are going to do when two of the people of the opposite team starts building Team Rocket Hideout?
I think there's a lot to learn from this, but I will bet that other games give much better satisfaction, Factorio, Roller Coaster and more.

There's so much more talk about this whole "strategy" thing. But is it probably for now. Apologies for not giving enough illustrations, since I'm still figuring out, how to make this post and other posts better.
