I"¾<p>Disclaimer: Using strategy guides, looking on the internet for solutions to give you an edge, is considered cheating in my book. (I feel thereâ€™s another blog post coming up for this subject.)</p>

<p>Before youâ€™re going to give me the middle finger or going to say â€œThatâ€™s impossible!1!â€ Well hear me outâ€¦</p>

<p>Computers or technology in general wasnâ€™t really my thing, until I couldnâ€™t be a car mechanic for some reason. Mind you, studying for a car mechanic isnâ€™t that easy, especially if youâ€™re in higher education and could easily pass the test. Iâ€™m going to stop you right here. You have read a lot and itâ€™s kind of boring if you donâ€™t like reading, which youâ€™re essentially doing when youâ€™re in I.T. (Except youâ€™re reading from the screen more often.)</p>

<p>Going into I.T. choices had to be made, â€œAre you going to be an administrator or are you going to be a programmer?â€ Is what the dean said to me. And I said â€œIâ€™m not going into programming, since I have no idea how things are working. (To be honest the classes werenâ€™t great But what can you expect?.) (1)
There are several years apart from me being a System administrator and going into Web development.</p>

<p>Starting off with the video video game calledâ€¦ Factoâ€¦. No, it was Monster Hunter Rise.</p>

<p>First of all, I play video games without Google, meaning that I donâ€™t have any clue about guides, things that the manual didnâ€™t provide and more.(2)
Andâ€¦ thereâ€™s a really large gap, were I didnâ€™t play games for a long time.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Rise, for me in general, is mastering your weapons to defeat monsters.
Mastering for me is, figuring all possible combinations of weapon attacks and applying this in the video game, in a decent manner, executing your attacks perfectly in a sequence.</p>

<p>This was the same thing for me in programming, gathering knowledge, figuring out, applying this in the text editor in a sequence.</p>

<p>Most difficult thing for me in programming was the part of using the search engines(s) in a different way.(2) Since most of the time, when I am facing a problem, I do this from the top of my head, again in a sequence. Of course I am using the search engine to compliment and verify my knowledge.</p>

<p>Right now, Iâ€™m using the search engine differently and gaining another perspective(s) through gaming. At the end of the day, video games helped me to figure things out in the video game itself and in real-life.</p>

<p>(1) To keep it short, we couldnâ€™t leverage the knowledge that we gained before the eternal question(s) into our programming side of things.
E.g. setting up your dev environment or LAMP server.</p>

<p>(2) Need to clarify, because Iâ€™m sure people donâ€™t understand this.
Thereâ€™s a difference for me, like: â€œPrinter doesnâ€™t connect to wireless internetâ€ and
â€œOffice JetPRo 9020 802.11 specificationsâ€ and figuring out your the Wi-Fi problems. (If you have knowledge about networks.)</p>
